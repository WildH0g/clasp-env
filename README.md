> CLI clasp environment switcher üè† [Homepage](https://github.com/WildH0g/clasp-env#readme)

## Usage

Run the following command (without prior installation):

```sh
npx clasp-env --folder <path_to_folder> --scriptId <apps_script_project_id>
```

## Run Tests

```sh
npm run test
```

## Project Description

### The Strategy

`clasp-env` is a command-line utility that allows you to switch between different Google Apps Script environments. When you write your code locally and deploy your Google Apps Script code with [`clasp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google/clasp), it creates a `.clasp.json` file that contains the `scriptId` property. This tells clasp which project it needs to push the code to.

When working in a team and/or with a client, you want to have multiple environments. At minimum, you probably want a dev environment (or multiple ones) in which you are working, and a test environment in which the client or your team can run acceptance tests before production. Of course, they must both be separate from the production environment.

`clasp-env` allows you to update the `scriptId` property in the `.clasp.json` file so that the code gets pushed to the intented project environment. The `<path>` indicates the path to the folder where the `.clasp.json` file is located.

It takes two arguments, `<path_to_folder>` and `<apps_script_project_id>`, both of which are mandatory. It then looks up the .clasp.json file in the folder and sets its scriptId to the one specified in the parameter.

### Include in `package.json` Scripts

You don‚Äôt want to type out the folder paths and IDs every time you want to change the scripts, so it‚Äôs best to save them in the `package.json`'s `scripts` property like so:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "clasp/dev": "npx clasp-env --folder <path_to_folder> --scriptId <dev_apps_script_project_id>",
    "clasp/prod": "npx clasp-env --folder <path_to_folder> --scriptId <prod_apps_script_project_id>"
  }
}
```

To switch to the prod environment, simply run `npm run clasp/prod` in the terminal and the `scriptId` property will be updated.

It‚Äôs also a good idea to combine `clasp-env` with the `clasp push` command. Accordingly, as soon as you switch environments, `clasp` will begin pushing your code to the project. The `-w` option at the end stands for ‚Äúwatch,‚Äù meaning that `clasp` will push your code every time you save a file:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "push/dev": "npx clasp-env --folder <path_to_folder> --scriptId <dev_apps_script_project_id> && cd <path_to_folder> && clasp push -w",
    "push/prod": "npx clasp-env --folder <path_to_folder> --scriptId <prod_apps_script_project_id> && cd <path_to_folder> && clasp push -w"
  }
}
```

To switch to the prod environment and push your code there, run `npm run push/prod` in the terminal.

Note that the folder must be a relative path from the project root. A typical project structure may look something like this:

```sh
my-app/
‚îú‚îÄ node_modules/
‚îú‚îÄ gas/
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Code.js
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ appsscript.json
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ .clasp.json
‚îú‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ index.js
‚îú‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îú‚îÄ package.json
‚îú‚îÄ package-lock.json
‚îú‚îÄ README.md
```

The Google Apps Script files, including `.clasp.json`, are in the `gas` folder; thus, the command should look like this:

```sh
npx clasp-env --folder gas ‚Äì-scriptId 1k1bnhRoqrESBvS95ZJncRYpsgSdM4anxwo3yI2Egs_Q
```

### .gitignore

If you use git with your projects, you‚Äôll also want to add `.clasp.json` files to `.gitignore` so that it‚Äôs not considered a change in the source code every time you switch environments. You can accomplish this by adding this line to the `.gitignore` file: `**/.clasp.json`
